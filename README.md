# Lost in Japan

Developed a 2.5D game that immerses players in a virtual exploration of Tokyo, Japan, based on my real-life travel experience. Utilizing pre-loaded images from Google Maps Street View, players can traverse forward, backward, left, and right through the streets of Tokyo. I built a custom game engine using HTML5 and Web Canvas, enabling smooth navigation and interactive gameplay. This project showcases my ability to integrate real-world data with custom game development, providing an authentic and engaging user experience.
